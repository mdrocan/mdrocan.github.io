## Work related

Currently I am working in Circles Consulting (<https://circles.fi/>) as the \
Director for the DevSecOps business unit. I am ramping up our activities in \
this area and at the same time helping customers with their software \
development projects. Whether your organization or team is in need of, for \
example, a software developer, DevOps expert, UI/UX expert or cloud expert \
do not hesitate to contact me.

Personally, I have a work history from small startups to large organizations. \
As a consultant I have worked in different roles with various customers in \
different parts of the world. I like to challenge myself and always aim to \
learn something new.

## Other activities

I enjoy doing different kinds of activities. Lately I have been doing a bit \
less long distance sports in general and focused more in home improvement, \
trekking, camping, hiking, taking photos and automation. I have also \
participated with my dog in NoseWork (1st and 2nd class) and water rescue \
exams.

### Sports
Ongoing "projects": some home improvements inside and outside, improve few \
Grafana dashboards that visualize misc things at home, a bit more sports \
activities including _Saimaa Cycle Tour 2023_ (<https://saimaacycletour.com/en>),\
 Finlandiahiihto (<https://www.finlandiahiihto.fi/>) and _Jukola relay_ \
(<https://jukola.com/2023/>).
