## Myself

I enjoy doing different kinds of activities. Lately I have been doing a bit \
less long distance sports in general and focused more in home improvement, \
developing small helpful software projects for myself and training different \
dog sports (NoseWork, water rescue, fetching) with my dog.

### Sports
Sports have been always important to me. Current activities include, for \
example, Saimaa Cycle Tour (<https://saimaacycletour.com/en>), Finlandiahiihto \
(<https://www.finlandiahiihto.fi/>) and Jukola relay \
(<https://jukola.com/2024/>).
