## Myself

I enjoy doing different kinds of activities. Lately I have been doing a bit \
less long distance sports in general and focused more in home improvement, \
developing small helpful software projects for myself and training different \
dog sports (NoseWork, water rescue, fetching) with my dog.

### Sports
Sports have been always important to me. Current activities include, for \
example, Saimaa Cycle Tour (<https://saimaacycletour.com/en>), Finlandiahiihto \
(<https://www.finlandiahiihto.fi/>) and Jukola relay \
(<https://jukola.com/2024/>).

#### Dog sports
- Peppi, the dog I train and compete with most often: <https://jalostus.kennelliitto.fi/frmKoira.aspx?REKNO=FI19376%2F20&Indeksit=0>

## Work related

Currently I'm seeking for a new job with something new and interesting.\
Previously I worked as a Lead DevOps Engineer at [Kraftvaerk Finland](https://kraftvaerk.com/).

During my career, I have worked in a variety of organisations in different \
roles. I like to challenge myself and push myself a bit beyong my comfort zone.\
I enjoy automating things, learning something new and continuously improving \
myself, ie. not just sticking to same ways of doing.
