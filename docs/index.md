## Work related

Currently I am working for Circles Consulting (<https://circles.fi/>) as the \
Director for the DevSecOps business unit. My goal is to help customers \
succeed with their software development projects and create value for their \
business. Circle's background is in having capable persons delivering \
solutions fast and with high quality. We provide solutions into software \
development projects, improving DevSecOps practices and providing efficient \
cloud practices to different project and handling data efficiently. Those \
are just examples, do not hesitate to contact me if you have another \
challenge and let's solve it!

I have a work history from small startups to large organizations being a \
consultant and internal employee. I have worked in different roles with \
various customers in different parts of the world. I like to challenge myself \
and always aim to learn something new.

## Other activities

I enjoy doing different kinds of activities. Lately I have been doing a bit \
less long distance sports in general and focused more in home improvement, \
trekking, camping, hiking, taking photos and automation. I have also \
participated with my dog in NoseWork (1st and 3rd class) and water rescue \
exams.

### Sports
Ongoing "projects": home improvement inside and outside, improve few \
visualization dashboards for misc things at home, improve code quality in \
my own software projects and, of course, doing a bit more sports than last \
year. Current activities include, as example, Saimaa Cycle Tour \
(<https://saimaacycletour.com/en>), Finlandiahiihto \
(<https://www.finlandiahiihto.fi/>) and Jukola relay \
(<https://jukola.com/2024/>).
