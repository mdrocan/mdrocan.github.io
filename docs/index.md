Currently I am working at Circles Consulting (<https://circles.fi/>) as \
a Director for the DevSecOps business unit. I am ramping up Circles' \
activities in this area, and helping customers improve their ways of working \
with software development projects. I have a work history from small startups \
to large organizations. As a consultant I have worked in different roles with \
various customers in different parts of the world. I like to challenge myself \
and always aim to learn something new.

I enjoy doing different kinds of activities. Lately I have been doing a bit \
less long distance sports in general and focused more in home improvement, \
trekking, camping, hiking, taking photos and automation. I have also \
participated with my dog in NoseWork and water rescue exams.

Ongoing "projects": some home improvements inside and outside, improve few \
Grafana dashboards that visualize misc things at home, a bit more sports \
activities including Saimaa Cycle Tour 2023 (<https://saimaacycletour.com/en>) \
and Jukola relay 2023 (<https://jukola.com/2023/>) in the long run.
