## Myself

I enjoy doing different kinds of activities. Lately I have been doing a bit \
less long distance sports in general and focused more in home improvement, \
developing small helpful software projects for myself and training different \
dog sports (NoseWork, water rescue, fetching) with my dog.

### Sports
Sports have been always important to me. Current activities include, for \
example, Saimaa Cycle Tour (<https://saimaacycletour.com/en>), Finlandiahiihto \
(<https://www.finlandiahiihto.fi/>) and Jukola relay \
(<https://jukola.com/2024/>).

## Work related

Currently I am working as a Lead DevOps Engineer at Kraftvaerk Finland (<https://kraftvaerk.com/>).\
I help our customers success in their business. My daily work includes, for \
example, implementing something technical that helps a team or supporting the \
a project team to transform the ways of working into more meaningfull and \
value-basexd.  I enjoy automating things, learning something new and \
continuously improving myself, ie. not just sticking to same ways of doing.

I have worked from small startups to large organisations, with different roles \
during my career. I like to challenge myself and always aim to learn something \
new.
